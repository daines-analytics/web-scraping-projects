    "SUMMARY: The purpose of this project is to practice web scraping by extracting specific pieces of information from a website. The Python web scraping code leverages the Selenium module.\n",
    "\n",
    "INTRODUCTION: Data.gov is a government data repository website managed and hosted by the U.S. General Services Administration. The purpose of this exercise is to practice web scraping by gathering the dataset entries from Data.govâ€™s web pages. This iteration of the script automatically traverses the web pages to capture all dataset entries and store all captured information in a JSON output file.\n",
