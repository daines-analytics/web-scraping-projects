    "SUMMARY: The purpose of this project is to practice web scraping by extracting specific pieces of information from a website. The Python web scraping code leverages the Selenium module.\n",
    "\n",
    "INTRODUCTION: Dr. Jason Brownlee’s Machine Learning Mastery hosts its tutorial lessons at https://machinelearningmastery.com/blog. The purpose of this exercise is to practice web scraping by gathering the blog entries from Machine Learning Mastery’s web pages. This iteration of the script automatically traverses the web pages to capture all blog entries and store all captured information in a JSON output file.\n",
