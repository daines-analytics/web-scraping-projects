The training set contains over 5000 descriptions of customers, including the information of whether they have a caravan insurance policy. A test dataset contains another 4000 customers whose information will be used to test the effectiveness of the machine learning models.\n\n\n\nThe insurance organization collected the data to answer the following question: Can we predict who would be interested in buying a caravan insurance policy and give an explanation why?\n\n\n\nIn iteration Take1, we had algorithms with high accuracy but with strong biases due to the imbalance of our dataset. For this iteration, we will examine the feasibility of using the SMOTE technique to balance the dataset.\n\n\n\nANALYSIS: From the Take1 iteration, the baseline performance of the seven algorithms achieved an average ROC score of 0.6965. Two algorithms, Decision Tree and Random Forest, achieved the top two ROC scores after the first round of modeling. After a series of tuning trials, Random Forest yielded the top result using the training data. It achieved a ROC score of 0.7159. After using the optimized tuning parameters, the Random Forest algorithm processed the validation dataset with a ROC score of 0.5285, which was significant below the result from the training data.\n\n\n\nFrom the current iteration, the baseline performance of the seven algorithms achieved an average ROC score of 0.6965. Two algorithms, Decision Tree and Random Forest, achieved the top two ROC scores after the first round of modeling. After a series of tuning trials, Random Forest yielded the top result using the training data. It achieved a ROC score of 0. 9243. After using the optimized tuning parameters, the Random Forest algorithm processed the validation dataset with a ROC score of 0.5746, which was significant below the result from the training data.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION: For this iteration, the SMOTE technique improved the unbalanced dataset we have but did not improve the algorithm’s final performance metric. Overall, the Random Forest algorithm achieved the leading ROC scores using the training dataset, but the model failed to perform adequately using the validation dataset. For this dataset, Random Forest still should be considered for further modeling and testing before making it available for production use.\n\n\n\nDataset Used: Insurance Company Benchmark (COIL 2000) Data Set\n\n\n\nDataset ML Model: Binary classification with numerical and categorical attributes\n\n\n\nDataset Reference: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Insurance+Company+Benchmark+(COIL+2000)\n\n\n\nOne potential source of performance benchmark: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/caravan-insurance-challenge\n\n\n\nThe HTML formatted report can be found here on GitHub."},{"title":"Binary Classification Model for Caravan Insurance Marketing Using R Take 2","author":"David Lowe","post_date":"Mon, 24 Dec 2018 13:50:05 +0000","link_url":"https://merelydoit.blog/2018/12/24/binary-classification-model-for-caravan-insurance-marketing-using-r-take-2/","blog_text":"Template Credit: Adapted from a template made available by Dr. Jason Brownlee of Machine Learning Mastery.\n\n\n\nSUMMARY: The purpose of this project is to construct a prediction model using various machine learning algorithms and to document the end-to-end steps using a template.

The executives have no choice but to “cooperate with the inevitable.” At the same time, every one of these four realities also exerts pressure on the executives. If the executives do not handle these realities effectively, the executive can expect very low performance and a poor result.\nReality No.1: The executive’s time tends to belong to everybody else. We can also describe executive as a captive of the organization. Everybody can move in on his time, and everybody does.\nReality No.2: Executives are forced to keep on “operating” unless they take positive action to change the reality in which they live and work. In most organizations, the executive’s work is mostly reactive. They often do not have control over the events or activities they must respond and address.\nReality No.3: The executive is constantly being pushed towards effectiveness because he is effective only when other people make use of what he contributes. The knowledge worker’s output, by itself, usually does not produce the required results until someone else acts on the output. This makes the executive’s time other people’s resources depending on the results the organization seeks.\nReality No.4: The executive exists within an organization. Specifically, there are no results within the organization. All the results are on the outside. The only business results, for instance, are produced by a customer who converts the costs and efforts of the business into revenues and profits through his willingness to exchange his purchasing power for the products or services of the business.\nThese executives inside an organization cannot change these four realities. They are necessary conditions of his existence, but, if leaving them unchecked, these four forces can also push the executives toward average or low performance. That means the knowledge workers in their organizations must make special efforts to learn to be effective or the ineffectiveness and poor results will surely set in."},{"title":"Drucker on Executive Realities","author":"David Lowe","post_date":"Thu, 25 Oct 2018 12:58:28 +0000","link_url":"https://merelydoit.blog/2018/10/25/drucker-on-executive-realities/","blog_text":"In his book, The Essential Drucker: The Best of Sixty Years of Peter Drucker’s Essential Writings on Management, Peter Drucker analyzed the ways that management practices and principles affect the performance of organizations, individuals, and society. The book covers the basic principles of management and gives professionals the tools to perform the tasks that the environment of tomorrow will require of them.\nThese are my takeaways from reading the book.\nDrucker had described the knowledge worker in a modern organization as an “executive.” The realities of the knowledge workers’ situation both demand effectiveness from the executives but also make it very difficult to achieve effectiveness.\nMany activities inside an organization have to do with effort and cost. To put it bluntly, the less (effort) an organization must do to produce results, the better it does its job. To produce the same result with less effort, the people (knowledge workers or executives) in an organization need to learn to be more effective.\nThere are four major realities over which the executives essentially have no control.

Sunk Costs","author":"David Lowe","post_date":"Sat, 15 Sep 2018 12:21:38 +0000","link_url":"https://merelydoit.blog/2018/09/15/ignore-sunk-costs/","blog_text":"In his podcast, Akimbo, Seth Godin teaches us how to adopt a posture of possibility, change the culture, and choose to make a difference. Here are my takeaways from the episode.\nOne of the things that have driven our culture and hardwired into most intelligent creatures is the fact that sunk costs are a real problem. The sunk cost problem is the idea that we stick with something, particularly if we put a lot of time or resource into getting that thing. Sunk cost is something happened before that cost our time or resources, and we cannot get that time or the same resources back.\nIf we need to make a new decision, how should we take the sunk costs into account? The new decision should be based on who you are and what you know right now. Without considering the sunk costs, will one approach represent a better path for us? We can usually put ourselves in a position to make better decisions by ignoring the sunk costs.\nInstead of factoring in the sunk costs into every decision we make, we should consider the sunk costs as a “gift” from our past self to our present self. If a given path is more suited to where we need to go without the “gifts,” our analysis should feel free to ignore them. More often, those “gifts” are completely irrelevant to making any decision about how we should spend our future time or resources.\nSunk costs might add a little bit of historical perspective to what we are doing, but they are not our friend. That is due to our past getting in the way of our future. Smart organizations will sell off or “refuse” that past gift from all the people who built it before, so the future version of the organization can focus on something else. Sunk costs often are not merely an economical choice; they are largely an emotional problem.\nWe worry about the sunk costs partly because we need to look for a story to justify our decision to others. We need to explain what it means to walk away from our past approach and off to the new path. We desperately want to avoid the feeling of cognitive dissonance. Ignoring the sunk costs means that we are brave and generous enough to forge a new path regardless of what they cost us to do something else before.\nAnother idea to consider is the idea of a dip. Dips come with all endeavors that are difficult or worth doing. In the search-centric world, when we are seen as the best in the world, we get an outsize reward. The position of “best” and the scope of “world” are all perspectives from the person who will acquire and pay. If ten people are interviewing for a job, those ten people are the whole world in the eyes of the hiring manager. The hiring manager is going to pick the “best” in that (ten-person) “world,” based on the criteria that matter to the manager.\nTo become the best in the world, we will need to quit many things. We need to walk away from all the cruft that is holding us back. By holding on to the cruft and applying the sunk costs to all decisions, it is easy to become a wandering generality rather than a meaningful specific. What professionals have learned to do is to ignore sunk costs and quit when they had to. We only have a limited amount of resources to invest. Holding on to the sunk costs or not quitting will only diffuse our focus and concentration. Instead of investing in many different things, we need to have the guts to go out on a limb and invest only a few things. We need to dig deep on those few things and do them in a way that helps us get closer to be the best in the world.\nThe dip is that moment of pain when we feel like quitting. Anything of scarcity and value has dips. If something does not have a dip, it is likely it will not be scarce and thus carries little value. When we are on the path to becoming the best in the world, we need to anticipate the dips so we can see them coming. We should not start a project naively believing there is no dip. What we ought to do is research enough and see where the dips might be. When the dips come, we will be ready to get through them. Those who come out of the dips on the other side enjoy the rewards of having done something that is scarce, and likely valuable to some people.\nTo get through the dip, what we must do is beginning with the idea of sunk costs. Everything we have done so far is a gift; they are gifts from our past self to our present self. The question we need to ask ourselves are whether those gifts have any bearing on where we want to go next? If not, we leave the baggage behind and instead double down on our present effort because we can see a dip ahead. To prepare for and power through the dips, those are the work that matters. We need to be able to walk away from beliefs or experience that we accepted without thinking about them and make a new decision based on new information. Ignoring the sunk costs leads us to decisions that matter to us and to the people who are counting on us."},{"title":"Ignore Sunk Costs","author":"David Lowe","post_date":"Sat, 15 Sep 2018 12:21:38 +0000","link_url":"https://merelydoit.blog/2018/09/15/ignore-sunk-costs/","blog_text":"In his podcast, Akimbo, Seth Godin teaches us how to adopt a posture of possibility, change the culture, and choose to make a difference.

Here are my takeaways from the episode.\nOne of the things that have driven our culture and hardwired into most intelligent creatures is the fact that sunk costs are a real problem. The sunk cost problem is the idea that we stick with something, particularly if we put a lot of time or resource into getting that thing. Sunk cost is something happened before that cost our time or resources, and we cannot get that time or the same resources back.\nIf we need to make a new decision, how should we take the sunk costs into account? The new decision should be based on who you are and what you know right now. Without considering the sunk costs, will one approach represent a better path for us? We can usually put ourselves in a position to make better decisions by ignoring the sunk costs.\nInstead of factoring in the sunk costs into every decision we make, we should consider the sunk costs as a “gift” from our past self to our present self. If a given path is more suited to where we need to go without the “gifts,” our analysis should feel free to ignore them. More often, those “gifts” are completely irrelevant to making any decision about how we should spend our future time or resources.\nSunk costs might add a little bit of historical perspective to what we are doing, but they are not our friend. That is due to our past getting in the way of our future. Smart organizations will sell off or “refuse” that past gift from all the people who built it before, so the future version of the organization can focus on something else. Sunk costs often are not merely an economical choice; they are largely an emotional problem.\nWe worry about the sunk costs partly because we need to look for a story to justify our decision to others. We need to explain what it means to walk away from our past approach and off to the new path. We desperately want to avoid the feeling of cognitive dissonance. Ignoring the sunk costs means that we are brave and generous enough to forge a new path regardless of what they cost us to do something else before.\nAnother idea to consider is the idea of a dip. Dips come with all endeavors that are difficult or worth doing. In the search-centric world, when we are seen as the best in the world, we get an outsize reward. The position of “best” and the scope of “world” are all perspectives from the person who will acquire and pay. If ten people are interviewing for a job, those ten people are the whole world in the eyes of the hiring manager. The hiring manager is going to pick the “best” in that (ten-person) “world,” based on the criteria that matter to the manager.\nTo become the best in the world, we will need to quit many things. We need to walk away from all the cruft that is holding us back. By holding on to the cruft and applying the sunk costs to all decisions, it is easy to become a wandering generality rather than a meaningful specific. What professionals have learned to do is to ignore sunk costs and quit when they had to. We only have a limited amount of resources to invest. Holding on to the sunk costs or not quitting will only diffuse our focus and concentration. Instead of investing in many different things, we need to have the guts to go out on a limb and invest only a few things. We need to dig deep on those few things and do them in a way that helps us get closer to be the best in the world.\nThe dip is that moment of pain when we feel like quitting. Anything of scarcity and value has dips. If something does not have a dip, it is likely it will not be scarce and thus carries little value. When we are on the path to becoming the best in the world, we need to anticipate the dips so we can see them coming. We should not start a project naively believing there is no dip. What we ought to do is research enough and see where the dips might be. When the dips come, we will be ready to get through them. Those who come out of the dips on the other side enjoy the rewards of having done something that is scarce, and likely valuable to some people.\nTo get through the dip, what we must do is beginning with the idea of sunk costs. Everything we have done so far is a gift; they are gifts from our past self to our present self. The question we need to ask ourselves are whether those gifts have any bearing on where we want to go next? If not, we leave the baggage behind and instead double down on our present effort because we can see a dip ahead. To prepare for and power through the dips, those are the work that matters.

What we ought to do is research enough and see where the dips might be. When the dips come, we will be ready to get through them. Those who come out of the dips on the other side enjoy the rewards of having done something that is scarce, and likely valuable to some people.\nTo get through the dip, what we must do is beginning with the idea of sunk costs. Everything we have done so far is a gift; they are gifts from our past self to our present self. The question we need to ask ourselves are whether those gifts have any bearing on where we want to go next? If not, we leave the baggage behind and instead double down on our present effort because we can see a dip ahead. To prepare for and power through the dips, those are the work that matters. We need to be able to walk away from beliefs or experience that we accepted without thinking about them and make a new decision based on new information. Ignoring the sunk costs leads us to decisions that matter to us and to the people who are counting on us."},{"title":"Ignore Sunk Costs","author":"David Lowe","post_date":"Sat, 15 Sep 2018 12:21:38 +0000","link_url":"https://merelydoit.blog/2018/09/15/ignore-sunk-costs/","blog_text":"In his podcast, Akimbo, Seth Godin teaches us how to adopt a posture of possibility, change the culture, and choose to make a difference. Here are my takeaways from the episode.\nOne of the things that have driven our culture and hardwired into most intelligent creatures is the fact that sunk costs are a real problem. The sunk cost problem is the idea that we stick with something, particularly if we put a lot of time or resource into getting that thing. Sunk cost is something happened before that cost our time or resources, and we cannot get that time or the same resources back.\nIf we need to make a new decision, how should we take the sunk costs into account? The new decision should be based on who you are and what you know right now. Without considering the sunk costs, will one approach represent a better path for us? We can usually put ourselves in a position to make better decisions by ignoring the sunk costs.\nInstead of factoring in the sunk costs into every decision we make, we should consider the sunk costs as a “gift” from our past self to our present self. If a given path is more suited to where we need to go without the “gifts,” our analysis should feel free to ignore them. More often, those “gifts” are completely irrelevant to making any decision about how we should spend our future time or resources.\nSunk costs might add a little bit of historical perspective to what we are doing, but they are not our friend. That is due to our past getting in the way of our future. Smart organizations will sell off or “refuse” that past gift from all the people who built it before, so the future version of the organization can focus on something else. Sunk costs often are not merely an economical choice; they are largely an emotional problem.\nWe worry about the sunk costs partly because we need to look for a story to justify our decision to others. We need to explain what it means to walk away from our past approach and off to the new path. We desperately want to avoid the feeling of cognitive dissonance. Ignoring the sunk costs means that we are brave and generous enough to forge a new path regardless of what they cost us to do something else before.\nAnother idea to consider is the idea of a dip. Dips come with all endeavors that are difficult or worth doing. In the search-centric world, when we are seen as the best in the world, we get an outsize reward. The position of “best” and the scope of “world” are all perspectives from the person who will acquire and pay. If ten people are interviewing for a job, those ten people are the whole world in the eyes of the hiring manager. The hiring manager is going to pick the “best” in that (ten-person) “world,” based on the criteria that matter to the manager.\nTo become the best in the world, we will need to quit many things. We need to walk away from all the cruft that is holding us back. By holding on to the cruft and applying the sunk costs to all decisions, it is easy to become a wandering generality rather than a meaningful specific. What professionals have learned to do is to ignore sunk costs and quit when they had to. We only have a limited amount of resources to invest. Holding on to the sunk costs or not quitting will only diffuse our focus and concentration. Instead of investing in many different things, we need to have the guts to go out on a limb and invest only a few things. We need to dig deep on those few things and do them in a way that helps us get closer to be the best in the world.\nThe dip is that moment of pain when we feel like quitting. Anything of scarcity and value has dips. If something does not have a dip, it is likely it will not be scarce and thus carries little value. When we are on the path to becoming the best in the world, we need to anticipate the dips so we can see them coming. We should not start a project naively believing there is no dip. What we ought to do is research enough and see where the dips might be. When the dips come, we will be ready to get through them.

Here are my takeaways from the episode.\nWhy do we tip, especially at restaurants in the US? We tip because it is not only a cultural thing to do, but also a status lever. We tip twenty percent because it is worth at least twenty-five percent for us to do that. The story we tell ourselves is that it is worth the status that we gain when we are dining with the people we are seeking to improve our status with.\nSylvia Bloom decided to give away eight million dollars to a charity that she was not an active part of.

It also can be a story about power, status, belonging, our parents, or about our children.\nThere are two lessons that nonprofit leaders can take away from this examination of tipping. The first one is that “people like us do things like this” is the definition of culture. It establishes a cultural standard. With cultural standard, it indicates either someone is one of us or is falling behind. The second thing is that raising money is a service. It is a service because we cannot force someone to do it, but we can open the door for them to contribute.\nWhen we think about tipping, we should be mindful that tipping in restaurant creates problems for equity and professionalism reasons. That person, whether at the table or in the kitchen, deserves the same dignity of knowing that they did a good job simply because they could. Their paychecks should not depend on the luck someone happens to leave an extra big tip. Those folks are professionals like us, and they deserve a living wage that we can give them. If we understand that, we do not have to put on the status show every time we go out for lunch or dinner.\nTipping helps us see that everyone tells ourselves the story on whatever we are doing.

We tip twenty percent because it is worth at least twenty-five percent for us to do that. The story we tell ourselves is that it is worth the status that we gain when we are dining with the people we are seeking to improve our status with.\nSylvia Bloom decided to give away eight million dollars to a charity that she was not an active part of.

It also can be a story about power, status, belonging, our parents, or about our children.\nThere are two lessons that nonprofit leaders can take away from this examination of tipping. The first one is that “people like us do things like this” is the definition of culture. It establishes a cultural standard. With cultural standard, it indicates either someone is one of us or is falling behind. The second thing is that raising money is a service. It is a service because we cannot force someone to do it, but we can open the door for them to contribute.\nWhen we think about tipping, we should be mindful that tipping in restaurant creates problems for equity and professionalism reasons. That person, whether at the table or in the kitchen, deserves the same dignity of knowing that they did a good job simply because they could. Their paychecks should not depend on the luck someone happens to leave an extra big tip. Those folks are professionals like us, and they deserve a living wage that we can give them. If we understand that, we do not have to put on the status show every time we go out for lunch or dinner.\nTipping helps us see that everyone tells ourselves the story on whatever we are doing. It is all about telling ourselves a story of what is it for, who is it for, and what difference are we, people like us, seeking to make?\nCulture can be hard to change because the status quo is good at fighting change.

Here are my takeaways from various topics discussed in the podcast episodes.\nWhen starting a business, figuring out how to get from where you start to where you need to be is If there is no such path, there is something wrong with your business structure.\nQuestions about the business model can include: how much does it cost to make a sale? What is the lifetime value of a sale? Do you make a product that people need to buy just once in their whole life? That is a very different than if you make a product that people will buy every day forever.\nThe answer to the question of “could you make a profit?” needs to be built into the business structure. Also, the question of “how do you maximize the lifetime value of someone who is expensive to reach?” For example, if your business normally delivers product or service via a one-time transaction, maximizing the lifetime value can take on multiple dimensions. One dimension is to deliver great Another dimension is that the reputation of your great service will spread when your customers tell others. When that happens, your future customer acquisition costs also go down due to the satisfied customers.\nAnother critical question for the entrepreneurs to ask is, “How do I apply what I have learned in the workshop and apply to the business structure which I was already committed to? Can I ignore the parts that will not work for my business?” Unfortunately, that is the wrong way to approach the problem.\nEntrepreneurs by their nature are bullheaded and committed because we can easily fail if we are not strong-willed. However, we can sometimes get hung up on and confuse between sticking with the right path and sticking with the wrong path. There is a lot of things we can do for our businesses, but falling in love with an archetype or the only vision you have in your head is not the way to do it.\nAnother critical statement to think about is “While it is possible to build the perfect entrepreneurial project, but I cannot do it because I do not see it.” The remedy to this hang-up is that you must start before you can see the end. Before we can see how the end plays out, we need to build the fundamental building blocks and put them in place.

Also, the question of “how do you maximize the lifetime value of someone who is expensive to reach?” For example, if your business normally delivers product or service via a one-time transaction, maximizing the lifetime value can take on multiple dimensions. One dimension is to deliver great Another dimension is that the reputation of your great service will spread when your customers tell others. When that happens, your future customer acquisition costs also go down due to the satisfied customers.\nAnother critical question for the entrepreneurs to ask is, “How do I apply what I have learned in the workshop and apply to the business structure which I was already committed to? Can I ignore the parts that will not work for my business?” Unfortunately, that is the wrong way to approach the problem.\nEntrepreneurs by their nature are bullheaded and committed because we can easily fail if we are not strong-willed. However, we can sometimes get hung up on and confuse between sticking with the right path and sticking with the wrong path. There is a lot of things we can do for our businesses, but falling in love with an archetype or the only vision you have in your head is not the way to do it.\nAnother critical statement to think about is “While it is possible to build the perfect entrepreneurial project, but I cannot do it because I do not see it.” The remedy to this hang-up is that you must start before you can see the end. Before we can see how the end plays out, we need to build the fundamental building blocks and put them in place. The building blocks, for each day, give us some success, which can lead to more success and get us to somewhere. It is about “did this move or interaction I made permit me to survive to make another one?” Can I keep piling on these interactions one after another so that they can form a virtuous cycle?"},{"title":"Permission and Trust, Part 1","author":"David Lowe","post_date":"Sun, 17 Jun 2018 12:13:19 +0000","link_url":"https://merelydoit.blog/2018/06/17/permission-and-trust-part-1/","blog_text":"In the podcast series, Seth Godin’s Startup School, Seth Godin gave a guided tour to a group of highly-motivated early-stage entrepreneurs on some of the questions they will have to dig deep and ask themselves while they build up their business.

It is a binary (2-class) classification problem. There are over 45,000 observations with 16 input variables and 1 output variable. There are no missing values within the dataset.\nCONCLUSION: The take No.2 version of this banking dataset aims to test the removal of one attribute from the dataset and the effect. You can see the results from the take No.1 here on GitHub.\nThe data removed was the “duration” attribute. According to the dataset documentation, this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y=“no”). However, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call, the target variable is naturally identified. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.\nThe baseline performance of the seven algorithms achieved an average accuracy of 89.22% (vs. 89.99% from the take No.1). Three algorithms (Bagged CART, Random Forest, and Stochastic Gradient Boosting) achieved the top accuracy and Kappa scores during the initial modeling round. After a series of tuning trials with these three algorithms, Stochastic Gradient Boosting achieved the top accuracy/Kappa result using the training data.

organism in one key way: internal mass grows at a faster rate than external surface; thus, as the organization grows, an increasing proportion of energy diverts to managing the internal mass rather than contributing to the outside world. Combine this with another Druckerian truth: The accomplishments of a single right person in a key seat dwarf the combined accomplishment of dividing the seat among multiple B-players. Get better people, give them really big things to do, enlarge their responsibilities, and let them work. Resist the temptation to redesign seats on the bus to specific personalities (except for the exceptionally rare genius), as this will inevitably create seats you don’t need. “The fewer people, the smaller, the less activity inside,” writes Drucker, “the more nearly perfect is the organization.”\n#10: BE USEFUL\nWhen I was just 36, Tom Brown, editor for Industry Week magazine, somehow got Drucker to invite me to visit with him in Claremont.

Recently a new subject of prescriptive analytics is getting a great deal of attention and discussion. William Vorhies examines both approaches to analytics and discusses their similarities and differences. Prescriptive versus Predictive Analytics – A Distinction without a Difference? (Data Science Central)\nA number of organizations are pondering the question of whether to commercialize the data they have for those who might find the data useful. Jennifer Belissent suggests ways to take your data to market and avoid some common pitfalls. Exploring The Data Economy Opportunity: Some Do’s and Don’ts (Forrester Blogs)\nMost of today’s senior executives built their careers in the pre-digital age, and many of them struggle to meet the demand imposed by the changes created by the digital business. Kate Smaje and Chris Wigley discuss a few practical tips that can help senior executives make the transition to digital. Five habits for executives to become more digital (McKinsey & Company)\nWith the availability of personal technologies, almost everyone has become a technologist in their daily lives.

Overcoming Data Obstacles for Integrated BI (The Data Warehousing Institute)\nThe emphasis of security used to focus on detection and protection. These days, response (especially Incident Response IR) increasingly becomes a key element of an overall security strategy. Bruce Schneier describes the OODA loops and why it is a way of thinking about IR in the real-time adversarial situations. The Future of Incident Response (Schneier on Security)\nSome would argue for the position that most systems are safe, and people are a hazard. As a result, all human involvement should be minimized in order to minimize human errors.

His thoughts on system administration and IT management resonate very well with mine. Why? Because I started out and grew up in my IT career as a sysadmin, I can totally appreciate where Jacob is coming from. Jacob also presented his viewpoints in a straight-forward, no non-sense style, which was a pleasure to listen to. When the video for the “Choose Your Own Adventure 2” session from Velocity 2011 became available, I had to check it out. Here are some concepts from the talk that I really enjoyed – I hope you will, too!\nDevOps: Whether you are in dev or in ops, we are still on the same team. It is also not possible to work in isolation these days – teamwork has to be it. Join the inclusive folks and ditch the ones who promote this us-vs.-them attitude.\nManaging Operations: The divide between dev and ops, we created and did it to ourselves. Allocate the responsibility correctly and everyone (dev or ops) needs to shoulder the burdens equally. After all, we are on the same team.\nNo Asshole Rule: Based on Dr. Robert Sutton’s great book, civility is still the noble goal to strive for these days. With the social network technologies, it is pretty easy to spread the passive-aggressive snarky crap and behave badly in order to put down or undermine someone else’s viewpoints or effort. Try not to do those things if you can.\nPhilosophy of Automation: Jacob explained why automate and I agree.

In the previous post, I presented some design elements to consider. As a follow-up, I will present two documents to illustrate the design process further.\nSample Process Requirements Document\nThe first document contains a list of sample process requirements. No different to engineering software or systems, the purpose of the requirement document is to capture all considerations that need to be factored into the process design. What activities will be carried out as part of the process and how one activity will flow to another? What information or data points get fed into which activities and what output are expected? Who will perform what activities and when? We need to define some roles, so we know who will do what and when. If you plan to implement a tool to support some portion of the process, some tool-specific considerations should be captured in the requirement document as well. The sample activities outlined in the document are pretty rudimentary and simplistic. You need to tailor your document with requirements from your organization.\nSample Process Flow Document\nThe second document contains a sample process flow. The process flow shows who is doing what and the timing of the activities. The flow document attempts to describe the process pictorially while the requirement document tries to carry as much description in text. It should be obvious that the process flow should be consistent with the requirements outlined, and, in fact, both the process requirement and process flow documents should convey the same information about the process. Some organizations combine the information from both documents into one requirement/design document, and that is perfectly fine.\nIn part three of the post, we will combine everything we have done and produce one final process design document. The process design document will include not only the requirements, the flow, and the roles, but also other information pertinent to the process such as the policy statement, a RACI chart, and the process metrics.
