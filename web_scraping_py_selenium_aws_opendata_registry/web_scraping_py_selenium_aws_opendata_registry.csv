The source lidar data and building footprints were obtained by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Homeland Security Infrastructure Program for 2006-2014. Using GIS methods, NREL identified suitable roof surfaces based on their size, orientation, and shading parameters Gagnon et al. 2016. Standard 2015 technical potential was then estimated for each plane using NREL's System Advisor Model. The PVRDB is down-loadable by city and year of lidar collection. Five geospatial layers are available for each city and year: 1) the raster extent of the lidar collection, 2) buildings identified from the lidar data, 3) suitable developable planes for each building, 4) aspect values of the developable planes, and 5) the technical potential estimates of the developable planes. The first and current version of the PVRDB is derived from 2006-2014, 1-meter lidar data from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for 128 metropolitan regions. Suitability is defined as any roof area that is less than 60 degrees in tilt; has an orientation facing east, southeast, south, southwest, or west; is in sunlight for a minimum number of hours per day (determined uniquely for each region); and has at least 10 m2 of contiguous area that meets the above listed criteria.

The goal of ENCODE is to build a comprehensive parts list of functional elements in the human genome, including elements that act at the protein and RNA levels, and regulatory elements that control cells and circumstances in which a gene is active. ENCODE investigators employ a variety of assays and methods to identify functional elements. The discovery and annotation of gene elements is accomplished primarily by sequencing a diverse range of RNA sources, comparative genomics, integrative bioinformatic methods, and human curation. Regulatory elements are typically investigated through DNA hypersensitivity assays, assays of DNA methylation, and immunoprecipitation (IP) of proteins that interact with DNA and RNA, i.e., modified histones, transcription factors, chromatin regulators, and RNA-binding proteins, followed by sequencing.",arn:aws:s3:::encode-public,S3 Bucket,us-west-2,Released and archived ENCODE data,bioinformatics,biology,deep learning,genetic,genomic,life sciences,machine learning,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Berkeley Lab’s Tracking the Sun report series is dedicated to summarizing installed prices and other trends among grid-connected, distributed solar photovoltaic (PV) systems in the United States. The present report, the 11th edition in the series, focuses on systems installed through year-end 2017, with preliminary trends for the first half of 2018. As in years past, the primary emphasis is on describing changes in installed prices over time and variation in pricing across projects based on location, project ownership, system design, and other attributes. New to this year, however, is an expanded discussion of other project characteristics in the large underlying data sample. Future editions will include more of such material, beyond the report’s traditional focus on installed pricing. The trends described in this report derive primarily from project-level data reported to state agencies and utilities that administer PV incentive programs, solar renewable energy credit (SREC) registration systems, or interconnection processes. In total, data were collected and cleaned for more than 1.3 million individual PV systems, representing 81% of U.S. residential and non-residential PV systems installed through 2017. The analysis of installed pricing trends is based on a subset of roughly 770,000 systems with available installed price data.",arn:aws:s3:::lbnl-tracking-the-sun,S3 Bucket,us-west-2,Tracking the Sun Dataset in Parquet format partitioned by State,energy,solar,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

ECMWF ERA5 Reanalysis,https://registry.opendata.aws/ecmwf-era5/,"ERA5 is the fifth generation of ECMWF atmospheric reanalyses of the global climate, and the first reanalysis produced as an operational service. It utilizes the best available observation data from satellites and in-situ stations, which are assimilated and processed using ECMWF's Integrated Forecast System (IFS) Cycle 41r2. The dataset provides all essential atmospheric meteorological parameters like, but not limited to, air temperature, pressure and wind at different altitudes, along with surface parameters like rainfall, soil moisture content and sea parameters like sea-surface temperature and wave height. ERA5 provides data at a considerably higher spatial and temporal resolution than its legacy counterpart ERA-Interim. ERA5 consists of high resolution version with 31 km horizontal resolution, and a reduced resolution ensemble version with 10 members. It is currently available since 2008, but will be continuously extended backwards, first until 1979 and then to 1950.

It contains instrument radiance in physical units; radiance quality indicator; geolocation for each IFOV at its native resolution; sun-view geometry; bservation time; and other attributes/metadata. It is stored in HDF5, conformed to CF conventions, and accessible by netCDF-4 enhanced models. It’s naming convention follows: TERRA_BF_L1B_OXXXX_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_F000_V000.h5. A concise description of the dataset, along with links to complete documentation and available software tools, can be found on the Terra Fusion project page: https://terrafusion.web.illinois.edu.

Terra is the flagship satellite of NASA’s Earth Observing System (EOS). It was launched into orbit on December 18, 1999 and carries five instruments. These are the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), the Clouds and Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES), and the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT).

Tabula Muris Senis,https://registry.opendata.aws/tabula-muris-senis/,"Tabula Muris Senis is a comprehensive compendium of single cell transcriptomic data from the model organism Mus musculus comprising more than 500,000 cells from 18 organs and tissues across the mouse lifespan. We discovered cell-specific changes occurring across multiple cell types and organs, as well as age related changes in the cellular composition of different organs. Using single-cell transcriptomic data we were able to assess cell type specific manifestations of different hallmarks of aging, such as senescence, changes in the activity of metabolic pathways, depletion of stem-cell populations, genomic instability and the role of inflammation as well as other changes in the organism’s immune system. Tabula Muris Senis provides a wealth of new molecular information about how the most significant hallmarks of aging are reflected in a broad range of tissues and cell types.See: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/661728v1",arn:aws:s3:::czb-tabula-muris-senis,S3 Bucket,us-west-2,https://github.com/czbiohub/tabula-muris-senis,biology,encyclopedic,genomic,health,life sciences,machine learning,medicine,single-cell transcriptomics,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
