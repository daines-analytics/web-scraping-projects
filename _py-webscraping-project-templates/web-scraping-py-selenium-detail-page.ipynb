    "SUMMARY: The purpose of this project is to practice web scraping by gathering specific pieces of information from a website. The web scraping code was written in Python and leveraged the Selenium module.\n",
    "\n",
    "INTRODUCTION: A demo website, created by Scrapinghub, lists quotes from famous people. It has many endpoints showing the quotes in different ways, and each endpoint presents a different scraping challenge for practicing web scraping. For this iteration, the Python script attempts to follow the links to the author page and scrape the author information.\n",
