And to guarantee data privacy protection, in addition to all your day-to-day responsibilities? OOF. Talk about a heavy lift. But in today’s world, efficient data de-identification is no longer optional for […]"Understanding the Design of a Convolutional Neural Network,https://machinelearningmastery.com/understanding-the-design-of-a-convolutional-neural-network/,"July 13, 2022",Adrian Tam,Deep Learning,"Convolutional neural networks have been found successful in computer vision applications. Various network architectures are proposed, and they are neither magical nor hard to understand. In this tutorial, you will make sense of the operation of convolutional layers and their role in a larger convolutional neural network. After finishing this tutorial, you will learn: How […]"A Gentle Introduction to the tensorflow.data API,https://machinelearningmastery.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-tensorflow-data-api/,"July 12, 2022",Adrian Tam,Deep Learning,"When you build and train a Keras deep learning model, you can provide the training data in several different ways. Presenting the data as a NumPy array or a TensorFlow tensor is common. Another way is to make a Python generator function and let the training loop read data from it. Yet another way of […]"Using Learning Rate Schedules for Deep Learning Models in Python with Keras,https://machinelearningmastery.com/using-learning-rate-schedules-deep-learning-models-python-keras/,"July 9, 2022",Jason Brownlee,Deep Learning,"Training a neural network or large deep learning model is a difficult optimization task. The classical algorithm to train neural networks is called stochastic gradient descent. It has been well established that you can achieve increased performance and faster training on some problems by using a learning rate that changes during training. In this post, […]"
