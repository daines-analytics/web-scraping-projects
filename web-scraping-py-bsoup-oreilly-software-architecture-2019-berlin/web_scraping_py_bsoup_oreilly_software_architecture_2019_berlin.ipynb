        "SUMMARY: The purpose of this project is to practice web scraping by extracting specific pieces of information from a website. The web scraping Python code leverages the BeautifulSoup module.\n",
        "\n",
        "INTRODUCTION: The Software Architecture Conference covers the full range of topics in the software architecture discipline. Those topics include leadership and business skills, product management, and domain-driven design. This web scraping script will automatically traverse through the entire web page and collect all links to the PDF and PPTX documents. The script will also download the documents as part of the scraping process. The Python script ran in the Google Colaboratory environment and can be adapted to run in any Python environment without the Colab-specific configuration.\n",
